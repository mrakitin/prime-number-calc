## Algorithm

The program implements the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**, which is one of the most efficient algorithms for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. The time complexity is O(n log log n), making it very fast for large numbers.

## Requirements

- **Compiler**: C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- **CMake**: Version 3.10 or higher
- **Google Test**: For running tests
- **Operating System**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Building the Project

### Prerequisites

1. **Install CMake**: Download from [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/)
2. **Install Google Test**:
   - **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev`
   - **macOS**: `brew install googletest`
   - **Windows**: Use vcpkg or download from GitHub

### Build Steps

```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure with CMake
cmake ..

# Build the project
cmake --build .

# Or use make on Unix-like systems
make
```

**Or use the provided build script:**
```bash
./build.sh
```

## Usage

### Running the Program

```bash
# Basic usage
./build/bin/prime_calculator <max_number>

# Examples
./build/bin/prime_calculator 100
./build/bin/prime_calculator 1000
./build/bin/prime_calculator 10000
```

### Example Output

```
Calculating prime numbers up to 100...
Prime numbers found: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
Total count: 25
Calculation time: 6 microseconds
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run tests
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure

# Or run the test executable directly
./build/bin/prime_calculator_test
```

## Continuous Integration

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for automated building, testing, and artifact distribution.

### ðŸš€ **Automated Builds**

Every push to `main` or `develop` branches, and every pull request, automatically triggers:

- **Build and Test** on multiple platforms:
  - Ubuntu (GCC & Clang)
  - macOS (Clang)
  - Windows (MSVC)

- **Artifact Upload**: Built binaries are uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts
- **Test Verification**: All tests must pass on all platforms

### ðŸ“¦ **Downloading Build Artifacts**

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in this repository
2. Click on any successful workflow run
3. Scroll down to **Artifacts**
4. Download the appropriate artifact for your platform:
   - `prime-calculator-ubuntu-latest-gcc` - Linux GCC build
   - `prime-calculator-ubuntu-latest-clang` - Linux Clang build

## Code Organization

The project follows modern C++ best practices:

- **Header Files** (`include/`): Contain class declarations and function prototypes
- **Implementation Files** (`src/`): Contain the actual implementation
- **Separation of Concerns**: Main function is separate from class implementation
- **Reusable Library**: PrimeCalculator class can be used in other projects

## Version Control

The project includes a comprehensive `.gitignore` file that excludes:
- Build directories (`build/`, `out/`, `cmake-build-*/`)
- Compiled object files and libraries
- CMake generated files
- IDE and editor files
- OS generated files
- Temporary and backup files

This ensures that only source code and configuration files are tracked, keeping the repository clean and lightweight.

## Performance

The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm provides excellent performance:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses boolean array for marking

**Performance Examples:**
- Up to 100: ~6 microseconds
- Up to 10,000: ~72 microseconds

## Error Handling

The program includes comprehensive error handling:
- Invalid command line arguments
- Non-numeric input
- Negative numbers
- Numbers too large for int type
